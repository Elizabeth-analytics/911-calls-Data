- seaborn
- folium

You can install these dependencies using the following command in your terminal or Anaconda Prompt:
!pip install pandas as pd
!pip install matplotlib as plt
!pip install seaborn as sns

## Usage
To use the 911 calls data analysis tool, open the 911_calls_analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. The notebook contains detailed instructions and code for exploring and visualizing the data.

Some of the questions that can be answered using this tool include:

What are the top 5 reasons for emergency calls?
How does the number of emergency calls vary by time of day and day of week?
Which areas have the highest number of emergency calls?
How does the distribution of emergency calls vary by township and zip code?
The notebook includes visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, and interactive maps to help you explore and analyze the data.
